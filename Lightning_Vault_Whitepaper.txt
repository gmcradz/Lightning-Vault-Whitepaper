⚡ Lightning Vault Consensus Whitepaper

1.  Overview

Lightning Vault introduces a novel consensus mechanism called
Proof-of-Vault (PoV), a hybrid between Proof-of-Work (PoW) and
time-locked Proof-of-Stake models. Unlike traditional blockchains, PoV
ties economic commitment and time duration directly into mining power
and reward distribution.

This design creates a system where: - Hash power secures the chain,
ensuring blocks are computationally verified. - Vaults (time-locked
balances) grant long-term economic weight, incentivizing users to commit
capital for extended periods. - Misbehavior is punished via vault
slashing, reducing the likelihood of consensus attacks.

2.  Proof-of-Vault Mechanics

2.1 Vault Weight Calculation

Each vault contributes to mining power based on amount locked ×
duration:

Wvault = A × D

Where: - A = Amount locked (in LVT) - D = Lock duration in days

The effective mining weight for an address is the sum of all its active
vaults:

Waddress = Σ (Ai × Di) for all active vaults

2.2 Reward Distribution

Each block has a base reward R, subject to halving every 4.5 years.
Rewards are distributed as follows:

-   If vaults exist: Rminer = R × (Wminer / Wnetwork)

-   If no vaults exist: Miner receives the full base reward.

2.3 Reward Halving

The block reward halves every 4.5 years:

Rt = R0 / 2^n

Where: - R0 = 10 LVT (initial reward) - n = number of halving periods
elapsed - Thalving = 4.5 years

2.4 Empty Block Mining

Blocks can be mined without transactions, ensuring: - The chain
continues progressing even with low activity. - Miners remain
incentivized via block rewards.

3.  Security & Slashing

To prevent dishonest behavior: - Mining proofs are bound to the miner’s
address, preventing proof reuse. - If a miner submits an invalid block,
their active vaults are slashed (burned).

Slashing Formula: Sminer = Σ (Ai) for all active vaults of miner

This creates strong disincentives for cheating, as miners risk losing
both future rewards and their locked capital.

4.  Difficulty Adjustment

Mining difficulty adjusts dynamically every ~10 blocks: - If blocks are
mined too quickly → difficulty increases. - If blocks are too slow →
difficulty decreases.

This stabilizes average block time around 60 seconds.

5.  Advantages of PoV

-   Economic Security: Attackers must lock significant funds for years.
-   Incentivized Loyalty: Long-term vaults align miner interests with
    network health.
-   Hybrid Flexibility: Falls back to PoW if no vaults exist.
-   Built-in Punishment: Slashing ensures accountability.
