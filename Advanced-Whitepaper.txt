Lightning Vault: A Proof-of-Vault Consensus Blockchain

Abstract

Lightning Vault introduces Proof-of-Vault (PoV), a hybrid consensus model combining Proof-of-Workâ€™s cryptographic fairness with staking principles through token vaults. Mining power derives from computational proofs and locked vault balances, aligning incentives between miners, long-term holders, and the ecosystem treasury.

1. System Architecture

Language: Python (Flask-based node, Waitress WSGI server).

Networking: REST + Ethereum JSON-RPC compatibility on port 5002.

Persistence: JSON-based blockchain state, with backups.

VM Integration: Experimental EVM engine for smart contract support.

2. Consensus: Proof-of-Vault (PoV)

PoW Function:

Payload = new_proofÂ² - previous_proofÂ² : miner_address.

SHA-256 hash required to meet difficulty.

Vault Weight:

Mining rewards scale with vault weight = amount * lock_duration_days.

Bonus tiers (0â€“3) grant higher mining efficiency based on vault share of network weight.

Rewards Distribution:

Base reward halves every 4.5 years.

Split: 30% miner, 70% vaults, 1% treasury.

Vault Slashing: Invalid PoW attempts burn all active vaults of offending miner.

3. Tokenomics

Ticker: LVT

Max Supply: 140,000,000 LVT

Premine: 20% allocated to founder addresses at genesis.

Halving Schedule: ~4.5 years per halving cycle.

Treasury Address: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000fee

4. Vault System

Vault Types: Time-locked MAIN token vaults.

Interest Rate:

Base: 5% annual.

Bonus: up to +2% for duration, +1% for large deposits.

Unlock: Funds + interest released after expiry, subject to supply cap.

Penalty: Vaults can be slashed for invalid miner proofs.

5. Transactions & Blocks

Transaction Types: transfer, mining_reward, nft_mint, nft_transfer, genesis.

Merkle Root: Ensures transaction integrity.

Mempool: Pending transactions capped at 100 per block.

Validation: Double-spend protection, NFT validation, vault balance checks.

6. NFTs

Native NFT contracts with:

deploy, mint, transfer, ownerOf, balanceOf, tokenURI.

Minting requires 10 LVT fee, credited to treasury.

7. Governance

Placeholder proposals & voting routes integrated (/governance/*).

Future upgrades: On-chain binding governance.

8. Ethereum Compatibility

Supported RPC Methods: eth_getBalance, eth_blockNumber, eth_getBlockByNumber, eth_sendTransaction, eth_sendRawTransaction, etc.

Wallet Integration: MetaMask support via custom chain configuration (ChainID 296070).

9. Security & Validation

Merkle Proof Validation for all transactions.

Vault Slashing against invalid proofs.

Backup & Recovery on corrupted state files.

Sybil Resistance via PoW + vault locking.

10. Roadmap

Q4 2025: Wallet release, vault system, NFT support.

Q1 2026: Explorer + advanced governance.

Q2 2026: Smart contracts via EVM engine.

Q3 2026: DeFi integrations & bridges.

âš¡ Lightning Vault is not just a blockchain. Itâ€™s a vault for your future.
