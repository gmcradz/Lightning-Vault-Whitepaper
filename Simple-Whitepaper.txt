Lightning Vault (LVT): The Proof-of-Vault Blockchain

Overview

Lightning Vault is a next-generation blockchain built for security, fairness, and community growth. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake chains, Lightning Vault introduces Proof-of-Vault (PoV): a consensus where users secure the network by locking tokens in vaults.

Key Features

‚ö° Proof-of-Vault Consensus: Miners gain rewards not only by providing computing power but also by holding locked tokens in vaults.

üîí Vaults: Lock your tokens for set durations and earn interest + mining power.

‚õèÔ∏è Mining Rewards: Each block splits rewards:

30% ‚Üí Miner

70% ‚Üí Vault owners (proportional to lock size/duration)

1% ‚Üí Treasury for long-term ecosystem support

ü™ô Token Supply:

Fixed total supply: 140,000,000 LVT

20% premine to founders for development

Halving every 4.5 years, reducing block rewards

üñºÔ∏è NFTs: On-chain NFT minting, transfers, and contract creation with simple APIs.

üìä Governance: Vote on proposals to shape the future of Lightning Vault.

üîç Explorer & Wallet: Integrated web wallet with balance, transactions, mining, vaults, and explorer.

Why Lightning Vault?

‚úÖ Fair ‚Äì Rewards distributed to vault owners, not just hardware miners.

‚úÖ Sustainable ‚Äì Block rewards decrease over time, respecting supply cap.

‚úÖ Accessible ‚Äì Easy wallet creation, NFT support, and MetaMask compatibility.

‚úÖ Secure ‚Äì Advanced chain validation with Merkle proofs, vault penalties, and double-spend prevention.

Use Cases

Earn passive rewards by locking tokens.

Mine new blocks while supporting network security.

Create, mint, and trade NFTs directly on-chain.

Build DApps with JSON-RPC Ethereum compatibility.
