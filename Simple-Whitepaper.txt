Lightning Vault (LVT): The Proof-of-Vault Blockchain

Overview

Lightning Vault is a next-generation blockchain built for security, fairness, and community growth. Unlike traditional Proof-of-Work or Proof-of-Stake chains, Lightning Vault introduces Proof-of-Vault (PoV): a consensus where users secure the network by locking tokens in vaults.

Key Features

⚡ Proof-of-Vault Consensus: Miners gain rewards not only by providing computing power but also by holding locked tokens in vaults.

🔒 Vaults: Lock your tokens for set durations and earn interest + mining power.

⛏️ Mining Rewards: Each block splits rewards:

30% → Miner

70% → Vault owners (proportional to lock size/duration)

1% → Treasury for long-term ecosystem support

🪙 Token Supply:

Fixed total supply: 140,000,000 LVT

20% premine to founders for development

Halving every 4.5 years, reducing block rewards

🖼️ NFTs: On-chain NFT minting, transfers, and contract creation with simple APIs.

📊 Governance: Vote on proposals to shape the future of Lightning Vault.

🔍 Explorer & Wallet: Integrated web wallet with balance, transactions, mining, vaults, and explorer.

Why Lightning Vault?

✅ Fair – Rewards distributed to vault owners, not just hardware miners.

✅ Sustainable – Block rewards decrease over time, respecting supply cap.

✅ Accessible – Easy wallet creation, NFT support, and MetaMask compatibility.

✅ Secure – Advanced chain validation with Merkle proofs, vault penalties, and double-spend prevention.
